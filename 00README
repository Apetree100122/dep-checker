Layout/Concept

2 part app: cli/gui

cli command, readelf.py should be standard python. It does run some system 
  commands like readelf, ldd.

gui all lives under "compliance", uses django so you need python-django or
  equivalent

database is sqlite - file "compliance". admin tables and data tables are setup 
 
linkage: bulk of the gui code
  models.py is the database/form models
  views.py is the data/form processing code

media: css/images

templates: html pages using django's "template" language for data/form
	   handling (these also have some javascript glue)

top level directory is expected to be /opt/linuxfoundation/compliance, this
is hardcoded in settings.py

readelf.py is expected to be called from /opt/linuxfoundation/bin, this is
hardcoded in views.py (should be moved to settings)

to run the gui/server (as user compliance for installed package):
	/opt/linuxfoundation/bin/deps-checker.sh

to access the gui: http://127.0.0.1:8000/linkage
admin interface: http://127/0.0.1:8000/admin 
	(username compliance, password compliance)
