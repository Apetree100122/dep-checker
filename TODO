do static analysis here or in gui?
still not completely happy with the way recursive output is displayed

  All:
	banner.html and header.html can tweak the look'n'feel
	need a way to stop the server

  Home Tab:
	fill this with some content

  Test Tab:
	need file/directory selection to work, modern browsers supress path
	looking at several ajax/js solutions atm

  Results Tab:
	bug in delete - doesn't work when there is 1 test

  Detail Page:
	too slow to render for large datasets, need to pre-setup a query
	haven't quite grokked how to do this in django yet
	re-look at how we display recursive results
